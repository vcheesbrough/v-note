# Attach the SQL console's proxy provider to the shared Authentik outpost (#299).
#
# Why this is a script and not a blueprint entry — the whole point:
#
# A proxy provider does nothing until an outpost serves it. The forward-auth
# endpoint answers 404 for a host no attached provider claims, which is why
# `authentik/blueprint-dev.yaml` alone leaves /dbconsole unreachable.
#
# The obvious fix — declaring `authentik_outposts.outpost` in that blueprint —
# is a trap. The embedded outpost is SHARED: its `providers` list also carries
# the providers protecting glances, woodpecker, uptime-kuma, the Traefik
# dashboard and the rest. A blueprint sets a list wholesale rather than
# appending, so that entry would detach all of them, and the blueprint is
# applied on *every branch push*, not just master. One careless entry, LAN-wide
# auth outage.
#
# So this does an explicit read-modify-write instead: read the list, append our
# provider if it is missing, write it back — and refuse to write anything that
# would remove a provider it did not add. It is idempotent, so it runs on every
# deploy and is a no-op on all but the first.
#
# Required environment:
#   AUTHENTIK_URL     base URL, e.g. https://auth.desync.link
#   AUTHENTIK_TOKEN   API token with permission to read providers and patch outposts
#   PROVIDER_NAME     the proxy provider to attach, e.g. v-note-sql-console-dev
# Optional:
#   OUTPOST_NAME      defaults to "authentik Embedded Outpost"
