# Post-deploy smoke check: is the SQL console gated, and did gating it break the app?
#
# Why this exists: the console's whole safety story is two Traefik labels and a
# provider attachment, none of which any CI stack can exercise —
# e2e/docker-compose.test.yml has no Traefik and no Authentik. The e2e suite
# proves the *database* boundary holds (read-only role, no superuser, session
# locked); this proves the *network* boundary holds, and it is the only thing
# that does.
#
# Three assertions, in the order they can fail:
#
#   1. /dbconsole/ must NOT serve the console to an anonymous request. A 302 to
#      Authentik is the expected answer.
#   2. /dbconsole/ must not 404 either. That is what an unattached provider looks
#      like (the forward-auth endpoint answers 404 for a host no provider
#      claims), and it is "the console is broken", not "the console is safe" —
#      passing on it would let the feature silently never work.
#   3. The SPA on the same host must still load. Two Authentik integrations now
#      share one origin, which is the part of #299 most likely to misbehave, and
#      a console that works by breaking login is not a trade worth making.
#
# No credentials and no session: this stops at the redirect rather than
# authenticating, so it needs no test user and is safe against any environment.
#
# Usage: V_NOTE_HOST=v-notes-dev.desync.link ./scripts/smoke-sql-console.sh
