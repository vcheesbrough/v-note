# Test scripts/attach-sqltool-outpost.sh against a stub Authentik API.
#
# Why this exists: that script does a read-modify-write on the *shared* embedded
# outpost, whose provider list also holds every other service Authentik protects
# on this LAN. A bug that writes a short list detaches all of them, and the only
# place the script ever runs is a deploy against live infrastructure — so the
# failure would be discovered by someone unable to log in, not by CI.
#
# The stub records what it is asked to PATCH, so these are assertions about the
# bytes on the wire rather than about the exit code:
#
#   missing      → provider absent from the list → PATCHes existing + new
#   present      → provider already attached     → no PATCH at all
#   no-provider  → blueprint has not applied yet → fails, no PATCH
#   no-outpost   → outpost name does not resolve → fails, no PATCH
#   lying-patch  → server reports it did not take → fails (read-back catches it)
#
# Mirrors scripts/test-smoke-oidc-login.sh and scripts/test-deploy-v-note.sh: a
# repo-owned script CI points at shared infrastructure gets a test that runs
# without that infrastructure.
