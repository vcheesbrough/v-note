 * #299 — the SQL console's *database* boundary.
 *
 * This stack has no Traefik and no Authentik, so nothing here can say anything
 * about who is allowed to reach the console; that is
 * scripts/smoke-sql-console.sh, which runs post-deploy against the real thing.
 *
 * What these tests cover is the boundary the #299 spike found was load-bearing.
 * pgweb advertises a `--readonly` mode, but it is a keyword filter over the
 * submitted text plus a read-only transaction — neither has anything to say
 * about a `SELECT`. Pointed at the application's own database user, which the
 * postgres image creates as a superuser, that "read-only" console returned the
 * contents of /etc/passwd via `pg_read_file`. So the privilege separation has
 * to come from Postgres, and this is that finding turned into a regression
 * test: if anyone ever reconnects the console as `v_note`, these fail.
