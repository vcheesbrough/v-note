-- #299: the read-only role the SQL console connects as.
--
-- This runs as the application's own database user, which the postgres image
-- creates as a **superuser**. That is precisely why this role has to exist: the
-- spike on #299 pointed pgweb at the app's credentials in `--readonly` mode and
-- got `select pg_read_file('/etc/passwd', 0, 60)` back. pgweb's read-only mode
-- is a keyword filter over the submitted text plus a read-only transaction —
-- neither has anything to say about a `SELECT`, so "read-only" against a
-- superuser is arbitrary host-file read. The privilege boundary has to come from
-- Postgres, not from the client.
--
-- Created NOLOGIN and with no password. The deploy sets both (idempotently, on
-- every deploy) so the password never enters git; until it does, the role exists
-- and can be granted to but cannot connect. Environments that never provision a
-- password — local compose, the e2e stack before its console starts — simply
-- carry an unusable role, which is the intended resting state.
--
-- ⚠️ CONCURRENCY. A role is a **cluster-global** object, but a migration is
-- per-database, so several databases migrating at the same time all run this
-- file against one shared catalog. sqlx's own migration lock does not help:
-- it serialises migrations *within* a database, and this race is *across*
-- databases. The test harness does exactly that — one throwaway database per
-- test, migrated in parallel — and without the two measures below it fails with
-- `duplicate key value violates unique constraint "pg_authid_rolname_index"`
-- and `tuple concurrently updated`. Both are handled rather than retried,
-- because the operations are idempotent: whoever wins, the end state is
-- identical.
